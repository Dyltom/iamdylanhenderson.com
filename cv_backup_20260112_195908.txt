Summary
Senior Software Engineer at Bonza Clean, leading the architecture and build of the company’s core platform from the ground
up. I translate real operational problems into scalable systems and ship quickly with strong engineering standards.
I work across product engineering, full-stack development, infrastructure, and reliability: SaaS platform development, CRM
and customer workflows, automated SMS/email communications, and mobile apps. I’ve also built practical AI automations for
data collection and customer interactions, including voice/chat experiences and phone automation integrated with
ElevenLabs.
I’m comfortable owning outcomes end-to-end: architecture, delivery, reliability, and continuous improvement. My default mode
is rapid prototyping with a clear path to production-grade systems.
Core stack: TypeScript, Next.js, React, Node.js, PHP, React Native, Sentry, databases and schema design, Linux/VPS
infrastructure, cloud tooling, component-driven UI (shadcn/ui)
